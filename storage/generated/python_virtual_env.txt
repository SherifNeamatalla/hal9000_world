To create a Python virtual environment, you can use the 'venv' module in Python 3. This module provides support for creating lightweight virtual environments with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories. To create a virtual environment, you can use the following command: python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment. Once you have created the virtual environment, you can activate it using the following command: source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
